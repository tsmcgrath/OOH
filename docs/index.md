# Own Our History Stage 0.
Welcome.
# Main Concept
I am a believer in owning your history. All of it. The good and the bad. That belief was strengthened when we lived for a time in Germany. They remember what they did in WWII. They teach it. They own it. We do not own it in the U.S. Most countries don't. Japan does not own up to their full history in WWII and earlier in China and Korea. The U.S. does not own up to its full history on treatment of indigenous peoples or slavery. But, we would all be better off if we did. If we raised more awareness, commemorate the uncomfortable truths, be honest.  Owning our History is a small, tiny, step, towards this. Maybe. If it works.
## Background

My wife and I lived in Germany for a time. In most cities there are something called "Stolpersteine" or "stumbling stone" inserted along the sidewalk. They are slightly raised up brass plaque's the you are supposed to stumble over. They commemorate Jewish, Sinti, and Romani, homosexuals, and other victims of the Holocaust. They mark the exact last place of residency, or sometimes work, of the person before he or she became a Nazi victim <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolperstein>. For me, these stumble stones, in every neighborhood, are an intimate reminder of the Holocaust. This is the Germans "owning" their history. They remember. It's moving to see these everyday. Everywhere.

I live in the Western U.S. If you drive Western highways you will come across some historical markers along the way. Most of these are put up by state historical societies or local boosters. Most often they are only white, pioneer, colonial history. Almost never is there mention of indigenous peoples history - unless it's a battle commemorative. I would rather we put up our own Stolpersteine. To commemorate our history. The good and the bad. From lynchings and the murders. To the purposeful spread of smallpox via infected blankets, the indigenous village massacres, the tribal dispossesion of land.

How do we do that? We could put up plaques, markers, etc... Maybe someday we will. But we have the ability to put up virtual markers more widely, much more rapidly, and maybe in a way that more people will learn about them. We can build a web services platform, databases, and API's that can serve up this information in 2D and also in mixed reality audio and visual markers. The text and audio can tell the human stories. The visual markers can be customized by artists to be powerful memorials.

Where do we start? The Southern Poverty Law Center has databases and maps of hate crimes <https://www.splcenter.org/hate-map>, current and historic.  There is also a lynching database available at Monroe and Florence Work website:
 <https://plaintalkhistory.com/monroeandflorencework/explore/map2/#8.5/47.6641/-122.0573>.
We can start with this data once we have permission.

We need leadership and voices from BIPOC community. It will not be suitable to have old white males in leadership positions. They can help by contributing. They can mentor. They cannot be the voice or the leadership. Their history is well represented. This project is to tell the history of the people who are not represented. Who did not, and do not, have their stories told.

# Open Source
This project will be open source. Open for anyone to contribute, to leverage, to use. If it takes off we will likely need some governance around content. Wikimedia is likely to have a good model to follow when and if this gets that far.

## Data Sources
There will be a need for multiple data sources. Each community should be able to control, organize, and customize their own. There will be need to be AuthN/Z that allows a DB to be locked down while it's developed. Or closed to only a certain community. Or be made available to the public.

# Features
It should have multiple forms of representation. Text, audio, maps, 3D art memorials, 2D art icons, etc... It should be:
- Discoverable while you go by the feature, in any mode - car, bike, walking.
- Explorable from your desktop
- Accessible from your mobile device
- Explorable via your Mixed Reality device
- ADA accessible

### Stage 0
- Further form and pitch the idea.
- Find one or more BIPOC person to lead and be the spokesperson. No old white guys. They can help, but not lead.  BIPOC defined: <https://www.sunrisemovement.org/bipoc-gnd-crash-course#:~:text=The%20term%20BIPOC%20stands%20for,the%20same%20levels%20of%20injustice>

### Stage 1
- Find and recruit engineers for an initial prototype to learn and iterate on.
- Define MVP
