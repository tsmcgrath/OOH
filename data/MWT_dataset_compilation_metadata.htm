This document serves as the metadata for the table MWT_dataset_compilation_SAMPLE.csv, which contains 119 arbitrary records from the MonroeWorkToday Dataset Compilation (version 1.1). This particular sample includes several records from Alabama, Georgia, Florida, and Illinois. The full dataset attempts to document one observation for each victim of a lynching, race riot, or semantically similar mob violence in the United States from 1803-2011. Geographic coverage before 1882 is known to be inferior to the rest of the data.
<br/>
<br/>
The data for the MonroeWorkToday Dataset Compilation originated with the historic record-keeping of Tuskegee Institute, conducted in the early 1900s by its Director of Records and Research, Mr. Monroe Nathan Work. These lynching records are currently stored in Box 132 at the Tuskegee University Archives. These records were merged by auut studio with the Tolnay &amp; Beck inventory of lynchings [1995 database] in a manual process to integrate all its additions and corrected information for the ten Southern States. The data assembly was then repeated for 62 more scholarly sources in order to include research published 1995 to 2015, including: lynching studies of other US states, narrative accounts mentioned in books, as well as academic journal articles that consider Sicilian-Americans, Chinese-Americans, Mexican-Americans, and others. Each new source was integrated by hand to prevent the duplication of records.
<br/>
<br/>
Extreme effort was taken by auut studio to stitch together these sources carefully under the following guiding principle: more recent, geographically-specific, or updated studies are allowed to correct the details given in a source that is older, more general, or was less confident of its own assessment.
<br/>
<br/>
In addition, auut studio labeled each observation with a code to represent the historical county in which the source author identified for the event. The codes for these historical counties, some of which are now extinct, follows the schema of the Atlas of Historical County Boundaries <a href="http://publications.newberry.org/ahcbp/">&lt;http://publications.newberry.org/ahcbp/&gt;</a>.

<dt><em>Purpose:</em>  
<dd>

This file provides 119 arbitrary records from the MonroeWorkToday Dataset Compilation (version 1.1) as an unfiltered table of potential victims of lynchings, race riots, or semantically similar mob violence in the United States. The word &quot;potential&quot; refers to the fact that further interpretation is needed by any researcher engaged with this data, as to whether some observations fit the researcher's own definition of lynching.

<h3>For years prior to 1882, the full compilation is known to be missing most or all lynching events for some states during those years. This compilation is not suitable for comparative analysis of regions prior to 1882.</h3>

<h3>This dataset consciously includes some observations which are ambiguous, and is not a &quot;neat&quot; or clear-cut list of victims. Any researcher who engages with this compilation must filter the list, and in so doing make some of their own decisions about which observations they intend to include.</h3>

auut studio was founded with the mission of advancing historical literacy and un-silencing the stories of people of color. The website MonroeWorkToday.org was a public history project of auut studio in 2016-2017. The full dataset is provided privately by auut studio to the recipient for use in a responsible research project, as a means to relieve the researcher from the manual digitization/assembly of the same public sources. In exchange for providing this courtesy, auut studio asks the researcher to agree to a standard of ethical consideration above what is typical in academia:  that in all of the researcher's published output, they will include language that acknowledges the personhood of murdered human beings underlying or aggregated by numbers, and that names white supremacy where it was involved. This includes some language, however short, captioned on any chart or graph that is intended to be interpreted or shown in isolation, whether in print or in presentation slides.

This full dataset compiles the prior research of dozens of academic scholars and authors. It inherits any inaccuracy or omission contained in each of these sources, unless later authors corrected the data in that earlier source. The geographic coverage and temporal coverage of events is a patchwork and not at all comprehensive.
<br><br>
For some cases, the table indicates an observation being &quot;Uncertain&quot; or &quot;Unconfirmed&quot; as to fitting the definition of a lynching. Unless otherwise indicated, this uncertainty is the interpretation from the source author(s).
<br><br>
The full compilation does not contain every lynching there ever was in the US. There will never be such a &quot;perfect&quot; list, because they were not always reported in a newspaper, or occurred in towns too small to have a newspaper. Some murders may have a faint record in historical sources, or none at all.
